## 2c. Linux Hosting Considerations

**Deployment on a Linux Server:**

- Use a process manager like **PM2** to keep the Node.js backend running, handle restarts, and manage logs.
- Use **Nginx** as a reverse proxy to forward HTTP/HTTPS requests to your Node.js app, enable SSL, and serve static files if needed.
- Store sensitive data (like DB credentials, API keys) in **environment variables** or a `.env` file, and never commit them to source control.
- For multiple projects, use PM2 to manage each app as a separate process, and configure Nginx with different server blocks (virtual hosts) for each project/domain.

**Example steps:**
1. Install Node.js, PM2, and Nginx.
2. Clone your repo and install dependencies.
3. Set up your `.env` file.
4. Start your app with `pm2 start npm --name "my-app" -- start`.
5. Configure Nginx to proxy requests to your app’s port.
6. Use `pm2 save` and `pm2 startup` to auto-start on reboot.

## 2d. Kafka Usage (Conceptual)

**Where Apache Kafka could be beneficial:**

- **Example 1: Logging and Analytics**  
	Use Kafka to stream logs or user activity events from your app to a central analytics service for real-time monitoring and analysis.
- **Example 2: Asynchronous Processing**  
	When a user uploads a large CSV or requests AI recommendations, publish a message to a Kafka topic. A background worker can consume the message, process the data, and update the database or notify the user when done—making the app more scalable and responsive.

**Summary:**  
Kafka is useful for decoupling services, handling high-throughput data streams, and enabling event-driven architectures in scalable applications.
